# About this proposal

#### Voting for this proposal means that you DO NOT agree that the following five principles shall be at the core of the Maker Governance philosophy:

- Scientific Governance
- The 20% Principle
- Sustainable Finance
- Gradual Decentralization
- Strong Market Focus
---

## Scientific Governance

The Maker Governance Framework will be built on rigorously vetted, reproducible, scientific models created by experts with proven track records in the traditional finance space.

The Framework itself can be broken down into two major components:

Governance Proposals: Symbolic votes used to poll community sentiment towards specific models or data sources.

Executive Proposals: Used to ratify the Risk Parameters determined by the models and data accepted by Governance Proposals. Executive votes result in state changes inside the Dai Credit System and occur every quarter.

This distinction encourages the governance debate to become a consensus-seeking exercise to reach a compromise, where communication channels force participants to focus on the underlying reasoning, theories, and data of risk assessments, rather than a polarising popularity contest about specific risk parameters for particular tokens.

In this model, neither the MKR holders nor the Maker Foundation will have any special powers to arbitrarily dictate the risk parameters of the system, they can only affect changes through fact-based, provable, scientific arguments.

## The 20% Principle

MakerDAO needs to provide more than just a technical upgrade to the financial system; it should also revolutionize the role of finance in the economy. Dai already levels the playing field for the unbanked and small businesses against the incumbents, but to truly make an impact we need to go further by ensuring Dai becomes a global engine for equality.

The Maker Foundation will allocate an amount of MKR from the dev fund that corresponds to 20% of the total MKR supply to continuously finance charitable initiatives or direct giving schemes that use Dai as the financial infrastructure. MKR voters will directly govern the charitable transactions, adding another crucial dimension of altruism to the governance philosophy. The 20% principle will be funded in a sustainable manner that ensures the charitable transactions always remain at exactly 20% of the system’s fees minus expenses.

Distribution of charitable funds will be managed through a process similar to the Governance Framework. The Maker Foundation will initially lead the community by presenting the best choices available, but over time the process will become decentralized, and completely controlled by the community through a framework that is based on data-driven impact analysis.

## Sustainable Finance

The makeup of the Dai collateral portfolio can have a significant impact on global capital allocation. It is therefore crucial that governance of the collateral portfolio take long-term societal, environmental, and sustainability impact into account. The Maker project as a whole must keep the principles of sustainable finance as a core value, and always include negative externalities as a key factor in risk assessments of collateral. This means that Maker will be biased towards, for example, renewable energy that provides a long-term global benefit, while being biased against funding fossil fuels and other assets that create long-term risk.

## Gradual Decentralization

The Maker Foundation is committed to true decentralization, but the road to decentralization needs to be a steady path taken step-by-step. This will ensure that the Foundation will have the support it needs to be successful, and protect against threats to the long-term goal of decentralization, such as a power vacuum. It is also crucial to provide maximal stability for partner companies that are integrating with Maker in various ways, as they need to feel safe there won’t be sudden changes due to rapid decentralization of governance.

The Foundation will drive Maker towards increased decentralization, with every step opening up more aspects of governance to community control, and eliminating single points of failure. At the same time, the Foundation will also take responsibility for teaching and providing guidance on how community members can most constructively contribute to governance.

## Strong Market Focus

In the short term, the Maker Foundation needs high levels of flexibility and more control over the growth and adoption of Dai. The Foundation will facilitate exponential user growth, business adoption, and dapp integrations to maintain the dominance of Dai across all markets for decentralized stablecoins.

This includes doing various low-level tasks in the ecosystem, such as managing the initial set of Oracle nodes and the first Emergency Shutdown (formerly called Global Settlement) infrastructure.

Before the new voting governance dashboard is released, the Maker Foundation will coordinate voting among highly technical MKR holders via command line tools, to avoid any disruption of Single Collateral Dai.

## Mechanics of the vote

If you DO NOT agree that these five principles, as written above, should be included in the core documents of the Maker Governance Philosophy, vote for this NO proposal.
